# TUI-Based-Server-Automation
This is a TUI based Linux servers management program,which enables us to "Configure" servers just by a click. 
The main advantage of this program is that we do not have to go in the "configuration file" of the respective servers which is the pain in server administration.

This program itself goes into configuration file and configures it according to our need.
The "Servers" which i have included are as follows.

1).Network File System(NFS)-Server --It is a remote login server which allows us to "Host Files" on a network.

2).Samba-Server -- Its is Used Connect Linux And Windows.

3). Secure Shell(SSH)-Server -- It is a "Remote-Login Server" which is "Highly Secured" our user id and passwords are encypted with "md5 Hash Algorithm""

This program may contains some bug which makes it not run properly.(My first Linux Based Program :))
There are some Pre-Required Softwares which are needed to run this program namely "Yum Server" which must be configured before.

How To Run It.
